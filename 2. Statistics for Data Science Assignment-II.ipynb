    "A skewed data distribution is one in which the data is not evenly distributed around the mean. There are two types of skewness: positive skewness, where the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side, and negative skewness, where the tail of the distribution is longer on the left side.\n",

If the mean, median, and mode are all approximately equal, the distribution is symmetrical.\n",

For example, in a positively skewed distribution, the mean may be higher than what is typical for the majority of the data, while in a negatively skewed distribution, the mean may be lower than what is typical for the majority of the data.\n",
