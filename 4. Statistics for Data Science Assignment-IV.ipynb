    "**Covariance** is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two variables are associated or vary together. Specifically, covariance measures the joint variability of two random variables. If the variables tend to vary in the same direction (i.e., when one variable is high, the other is also high), the covariance will be positive. If the variables tend to vary in opposite directions (i.e., when one variable is high, the other is low), the covariance will be negative. If the variables are not related, the covariance will be close to zero.\n",

A correlation coefficient of -1 or 1 indicates a perfect negative or positive relationship, respectively, while a coefficient of 0 indicates no relationship between the variables.

    "**`Q4.`** **What are the advantages of Spearman Correlation over Pearson Correlation ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Ans`** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Applicability to non-linear relationships:** Pearson correlation measures only linear relationships between two variables, while Spearman correlation is also applicable to monotonic relationships, whether they are increasing or decreasing. This makes Spearman correlation more versatile and applicable to a wider range of data.\n",
    "2. **Robustness to outliers:** Pearson correlation is sensitive to outliers, meaning that a single extreme value can have a large impact on the correlation coefficient. Spearman correlation is less sensitive to outliers because it is based on ranks rather than actual values.\n",
    "3. **Applicability to ordinal data:** Pearson correlation assumes that the data is continuous and normally distributed. Spearman correlation, on the other hand, is applicable to both continuous and ordinal data, making it a more versatile tool for analyzing a variety of data types.\n",
    "4. **Ease of interpretation:** The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on ranks, which are easy to interpret and understand. In contrast, interpreting Pearson correlation requires a more complex understanding of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "5. **More robust to violations of assumptions:** Pearson correlation is based on several assumptions, such as normality and linearity. If these assumptions are violated, the Pearson correlation coefficient may not accurately reflect the true relationship between the variables. Spearman correlation is less sensitive to these violations and may be more appropriate in situations where the assumptions of Pearson correlation are not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Spearman correlation has advantages over Pearson correlation in terms of its applicability to non-linear relationships, robustness to outliers, applicability to ordinal data, ease of interpretation, and robustness to violations of assumptions. However, it should be noted that the choice of correlation coefficient depends on the research question being asked and the nature of the data being analyzed."

The theorem states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
