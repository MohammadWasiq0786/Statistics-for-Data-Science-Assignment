    "A **probability distribution function (PDF)** is a function that describes the probability of a random variable taking on a certain value or set of values. It is a mathematical description of the likelihood of different outcomes in a random process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is used to calculate the probability of a particular event occurring in a continuous distribution. It is represented by a curve, where the x-axis represents the values of the random variable, and the y-axis represents the probability of that value occurring. The area under the curve equals 1, meaning that the sum of all probabilities for all possible outcomes equals 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF can be used to determine the expected value, variance, and other statistical properties of a random variable. The expected value is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where the weight is the probability of that outcome occurring. The variance measures the spread of the distribution around the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of probability distributions, including the normal distribution, the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, and the exponential distribution, among others. Each type of distribution has a unique PDF that describes the likelihood of different outcomes."
